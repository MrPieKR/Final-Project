            <h1>OUR STORY</h1>     
            <p>Founded in 2010 our website was created by our Kevin Reyes. Born in Griffin, GA he would spend so much time going fishing and camping with his 
                family when he was younger. When he grew up now wanting to take his family out camping just like he did when he was younger. 
                He came across a problem of not being able to find enough information on the few sites that existed during these times about 
                the different campsites in the state of Georgia. This would lead him to create this website in order to provide people with 
                the most information about the different campsites in the state. Including all the attractions and activities found nearby. 
            </p>
